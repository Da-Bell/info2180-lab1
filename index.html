        <p>I am a UWI Mona student in my 4th year of my Computer Science Major. I started this major in hopes to be able to work in website development and game design. This is my first class where I can see that happening. Hopefully I do well in this assignment. I was scared at first since this was 15 pages but I understood it fairly well I think.</p>
